# Samsung Health Integration Guide

Samsung Health doesn't have a direct public API, but we can use Samsung Health data through several methods:

## Method 1: Google Fit Integration (Recommended)

Samsung Health can sync with Google Fit, which has a robust API.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Enable Samsung Health → Google Fit Sync**:
   - Open Samsung Health app
   - Go to Settings → Connected services
   - Connect to Google Fit
   - Enable data sharing for steps, sleep, heart rate, weight

2. **Create Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create new project: "AI Mentor Hub" 
   - Go to **APIs & Services → Library**
   - Search for **"Fitness API"** and **Enable** it ✅

3. **Get API Credentials**:
   - Go to APIs & Services → Credentials
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Application type: Web application
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google`
   - Add scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/fitness.activity.read`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/fitness.sleep.read`

### Implementation
